# LiveWebDashboard
Welcome my Project !

<b>You can sign up and login to dashboard.</b>
Dashboard has two parts.
These are User's info and Admin Panel.

The only requirement for registration is that you are over 18 years old.
There is no need to add ip for the database.As soon as successfully registered, the information goes to the database.

There are four main sections on the homepage and can be accessed by clicking on them.

As soon as the information is entered correctly in the login section, you can go to the dashboard.
If it is entered incorrectly, you will receive an alert and go to the homepage.

<b>Your session remains open until you click the sign out button.</b>

In my project, I supported the structure between backend and frontend by using the http cookie structure.

Thank you for looking!
