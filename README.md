# LiveWebDashboard
Welcome my Project !

The project is entered with only an id/password for now.<b>id == "admin" / password == "1234"</b>

The only requirement for registration is that you are over 18 years old.
There is no need to add ip for the database.As soon as successfully registered, the information goes to the database.
but you cannot login with the same information for now.

There are four main sections on the homepage and can be accessed by clicking on them.

As soon as the information is entered correctly in the login section, you can direct it to the dashboard.
If it is entered incorrectly, you will receive an alert and go to the homepage.

In my project, I supported the structure between backend and frontend by using the http cookie structure.

Thank you for looking!
